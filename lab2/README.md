# Lab2

### Lab purpose

Learn about streams and tasks. There will be exercises for playing with both.

### Lab instructions

The `lab2` directory is divided into two files: `streams.ex` and `tasks.ex`. They both contain
stubbed out functions that you will implement. The job of each function to implement is described
in its documentation.

Tests in `lab2/test/lab2_test.exs` are tagged as `@tag :skip`. When you run `mix test`, all tests
are skipped so you will see all tests "passing". You should remove or comment out the `@tag :skip`
line above the first test and then run tests to see that test fail. Then, implement the first
function until the test passes. Repeat for all other functions.
