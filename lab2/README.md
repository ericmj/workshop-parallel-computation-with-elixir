# Lab2

### Lab purpose

Learn about streams and tasks. There will be exercises for playing with both.

### Lab instructions

The `lab2` directory is divided into two files: `streams.ex` and `tasks.ex`. They both contain
stubbed out functions that you will implement. The job of each function to implement is described
in its documentation.
