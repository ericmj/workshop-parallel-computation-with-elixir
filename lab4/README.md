# Lab4

### Lab purpose

Learn about Flow. We will extend on streams and GenStage to express computation flows on large
collections of data.

### Lab instructions

The `lab4` directory has a file `lib/lab4.ex` which contains an implementation of chat
room with some stubbed out functions. As usual, use that template to implement functions
until all tests pass.

  1. Use Flow to a sum an enumerable of integers.

  2. Return the N most frequently occurring words in a file.
